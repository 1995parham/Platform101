## IoT Courses

### SSC Summer Course 2017

This course held in the summer of 2017 with the help of the students' scientific chapter of Amirkabir University of Technology.
This course aims to help students to start using IoT platforms besides their hardware projects. Here you can see its topics at a glance:

- IoT big picture
- why using smart things alone? when things comes together ...
- IoT platfroms
- Kaa!? The Platform
- Temperature system implementation over kaa
